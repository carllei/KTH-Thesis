# Node-RED flows

This directory contains all the Node-RED flows used for my thesis. The flows were used for the performance testing conducted for my performance analysis of Node-RED in an AMD-SEV-enabled virtual machine. The original sources for the flows are included below. Some of the flows might have been altered from the original source.
